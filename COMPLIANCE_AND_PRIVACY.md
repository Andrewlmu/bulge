  return AES.encrypt(data, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY);
};

// Example: Automatic data anonymization
const anonymizeUserData = (userData) => {
  return {
    ...userData,
    id: generateUUID(),
    email: null,
    name: null,
    createdAt: userData.createdAt
  };
};
```

**Organizational Measures**

**Implementation Examples**
```javascript
// Data export functionality
const exportUserData = async (userId) => {
  const userData = await getUserData(userId);
  const exportData = {
    profile: userData.profile,
    workouts: userData.workouts,
    nutrition: userData.nutrition,
    achievements: userData.achievements,
    preferences: userData.preferences
  };
  return JSON.stringify(exportData, null, 2);
};

// Account deletion with data purging
const deleteUserAccount = async (userId) => {
  await anonymizeUserData(userId);
  await deleteUserContent(userId);
  await removeFromAnalytics(userId);
  await notifyThirdParties(userId);
};
